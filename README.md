# Unelma-Code Translator

Welcome to **Unelma-Code Translator**, an open-source tool that uses AI to translate code between programming languages. Whether you're porting a Python script to JavaScript, adapting C++ to Java, or exploring a new language, this project aims to save you time and effort with smart, context-aware translations. Built by [Unelma Platforms](https://unelmaplatforms.com/), it’s free, collaborative, and ready for your input!

## Why Use It?

- **AI-Powered**: Goes beyond syntax—understands logic and intent.
- **Multi-Language**: Supports a growing list of languages (Python, Java, C++, JS, and more to come).
- **Open-Source**: Free to use, modify, and improve under the [MIT License](#license).
